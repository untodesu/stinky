# What the hell?
This repo contains a list of people who have displayed a noticeable amount of toxicity and/or saltiness towards their fellow game server dwellers.

# Isn't that a little bit too subjective?
Yes. Cry about it.

# Can I add some people?
Sure thing. Fork the repo, create an INI/TOML file with their Steam ID as the filename (`steamid.ini`) and put appropriate proof in there following this example:  

```ini
description = Has been calling people racial slurs
proof_youtube = https://youtu.be/ABCDEF
proof_image = https://link-to-your-image.com/proof.jpg
```

Then create a pull request and wait for me (or any other maintainer if it gets to that point) to validate and merge the PR.

# What if I delete the video proof later?
I will eventually put a system in place to automatically validate and purge entries with outdated and unreachable proof links.

# What if I am on that list?
Womp-womp. Too bad!  

Seriously though, if you provide more context than the initial committer, it might be possible to remove you from the list
